# Quality Guidelines

> Code quality standards for backend development.

---

## Overview

Backend changes must preserve the current FastAPI + async SQLAlchemy + Clean Architecture / DDD-oriented structure. Code should be production-ready on the first pass: no temporary stubs, no fake behavior, no hardcoded secrets.

---

## Required Patterns

- Inspect affected files before proposing edits.
- Keep API routes thin: validate input, collect dependencies, call services, serialize output.
- Keep business rules in `backend/app/domain/*` or `backend/app/services/*`.
- Keep repositories limited to CRUD/query persistence work.
- Use `UnitOfWork` for transaction boundaries.
- When a service receives runtime URLs or adapters through its constructor, keep helper branches aligned with those injected values instead of re-reading equivalent global settings only. This preserves direct service tests and non-HTTP entrypoints.
- Use backend permissions/action flags as the source of truth for allowed actions.
- Keep Keycloak-backed E2E provisioning aligned with the realm user-profile schema. If Keycloak makes a profile attribute required (for example `middleName`), populate it during smoke-user creation so tests do not stall on required-action forms before the SPA loads.
- Keep in-memory integration fixtures aligned with current dataclass constructors and service factory signatures; when request/offer schemas gain or lose fields, update the test factories in the same change.
- Preserve legacy Telegram functionality unless removal is explicitly requested.
- For DB changes, include SQL/migration patch and rollout notes.
- For infra changes, preserve `gateway`, `project_net`, and tunnel routing.

---

## Forbidden Patterns

- Business logic in API routes.
- Permission enforcement only on the frontend.
- Repository methods that decide business policy.
- Direct public exposure of backend, Keycloak, RabbitMQ, MinIO, PostgreSQL, or admin ports in `test`/`prod`.
- Hardcoded secrets, tokens, passwords, or production hostnames.
- Temporary placeholder implementations, mock-only production paths, or TODO-dependent behavior.
- Removing Telegram compatibility code or compose rollback comments without an explicit task.
- Changing DB schema because it is convenient rather than required by the task.

## Permissions Checklist

When a backend change affects permissions/actions:

- [ ] Permission codes are defined/updated centrally in `backend/app/domain/permissions.py`.
- [ ] Domain policies or service rules enforce the behavior.
- [ ] Internal staff visibility uses the shared scope services consistently:
  `StaffAccessScopeService` for module scope and `DepartmentScopeService` for subdivision/department scope.
- [ ] User/staff list endpoints do not fall back to ad hoc direct-subordinate-only filtering when module/department scope already exists elsewhere in requests/plans.
- [ ] Internal staff list scope remains aligned with the current contract:
  project manager -> department/subdivision scope;
  lead economist / economist -> module scope by default;
  department delegation permissions -> broaden to department/subdivision scope.
- [ ] `department.requests.status_update` is enforced independently for foreign department requests; `department.requests.update` must not implicitly grant status transitions.
- [ ] Department offer status actions remain independent: `department.requests.update` must not implicitly grant `department.offers.accept` or `department.offers.reject`.
- [ ] Department offer content actions remain independent: `department.requests.update` must not implicitly grant amount/file edits; use `department.offers.update`.
- [ ] Contractor-specific request view checks `requests.contractor_view.read` explicitly at backend service/policy level.
- [ ] Offer acceptance flow rejects `accepted` transition when parent request is already `closed` or `cancelled`.
- [ ] API responses expose backend-owned permissions/actions/links for frontend UX.
- [ ] Frontend does not become the final decision maker.
- [ ] Tests or targeted validation cover denied and allowed paths when feasible.

## Testing Requirements

Run the narrowest meaningful checks for the task and report them. Typical commands:

```powershell
python -m pytest
```

If checks cannot be run, state why and list the residual risk.

## Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Layering boundaries are preserved.
- [ ] UoW owns transactions.
- [ ] Repositories are persistence-only.
- [ ] DB changes have explicit SQL/migration patch.
- [ ] Runtime/gateway/network shape is unchanged unless explicitly requested.
- [ ] Legacy Telegram paths were considered when relevant.
- [ ] No secrets or temporary stubs were introduced.
